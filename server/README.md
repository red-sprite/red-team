# RSBSServer
Red Sprite Battleships server

A base implementation of a NodeJS REST API server to support the Red Sprite Battleships challenge.<br><br>


# Getting Started
Assuming you already have nodeJS installed, you can clone this project and run npm install within the root folder. This will download the various required packages defined in the package.json file.

It is worth installing nodemon too if you don't already have it
### `npm install -g nodemon`

When you start the server, use
### `start nodemon bin\www`

This will cause the nodeJS server to restart each time you modify the js files so you don't have to keep stopping and starting node
